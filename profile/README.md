## About Eagle

Eagle transforms how creative professionals manage and organize their visual assets by providing a specialized environment designed specifically for image collections and design resources. This powerful application serves as a comprehensive digital library for designers, photographers, and visual creators who accumulate large quantities of reference images, inspiration materials, and project assets. Unlike generic file managers, Eagle understands the unique needs of visual workflows, offering features like color-based searching, visual similarity detection, and flexible organization systems that adapt to creative thinking patterns rather than forcing rigid folder hierarchies.

The application excels in its ability to handle diverse visual content while maintaining fast performance even with libraries containing hundreds of thousands of images. Eagle's sophisticated metadata extraction automatically captures information from images, including colors, dimensions, and embedded metadata, while its browser extension enables seamless collection of visual inspiration from across the web. With support for annotations, notes, and customizable organizational systems, Eagle becomes an extension of the creative thought process, helping users not just store their visual resources but actually leverage them effectively throughout their creative projects and workflows.
